Nu Open Source Art Engine

Welcome to the Nu Open Source Art Engine, a powerful tool for generating unique and customizable art collections. Inspired by the classic Hashlips Art Engine, this project offers enhanced features and flexibility for artists and developers alike.

Features
Trait-Based Collections: Create diverse collections by defining traits and generating unique combinations.
Multiple Choice Options: Customize generation with multiple choice options for functions, enabling more control over the output.
Automated Directory Management: Directories are auto-built and cleared, simplifying the organization of generated assets.
Hashing and Duplication Checking: Generates a SHA256 hash for each generation and checks against a hashlist to avoid duplicate outputs.
JSON and Metadata Creation: Automatically creates .json and .metadata files for each generation, providing additional information and metadata.
Upscaling and Saving: Upscales generations to desired sizes and saves them for easy access and distribution.
Usage
Setup Layers: Organize layer components within the /layers directory of the NuArt directory.
Install Dependencies: Run npm install to install the required dependencies listed at the top of the script.
Generate Collections: Execute node run.js and follow the prompts to generate collections.
View Output: Check the output folders for generated files, including metadata.json, hashlist.txt, and directories for JSON and images.
